				<h2>Technology</h2>
				<p>Technology can be defined as the knowledge or a set of tools that helps to make things easier or helps in resolving certain problems.
					For example, the pen is one of the first technologies that made it easier for humans write and remember their thoughts.
					 <br>
					That technology was later improved upon with the development of the printing press. This device made it easier to mass produce the written word,
					 allowing everyone to share his or her information with others. 
					Later, typewriters were created, which made it easier and faster for people to create their own documents by typing instead of writing. 
					Finally, the computer was created, which over time has greatly improved on all previous technologies in the context of writing and the sharing of information.
					<br>
				  In the present globalized world, we are living in the era of advanced technology. Every part of our daily life is related to technology in one or other way. When compared with olden days, we are having better facilities and even better luxuries with the help of increased technology. The development of technology is not confined to any one sector and all the industries and different sectors of society are developing new technologies according to their needs and requirements.

With the use of same internet children are getting addicted to online games and their physical activities and exercises are becoming considerably less. The same social networks are creating rivalry between best friends and couples are getting divorced.
